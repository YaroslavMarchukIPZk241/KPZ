## Abstract Factory
The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their exact classes.

## Factory
The Factory pattern defines an interface for object creation while allowing subclasses to determine the type of objects to be created.

## Singleton
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it.

## Prototype
The Prototype pattern allows for cloning objects, creating new instances by copying an existing one rather than instantiating from scratch.

## Builder
The Builder pattern separates the construction process of a complex object from its final representation, allowing different representations to be created using the same construction process.
